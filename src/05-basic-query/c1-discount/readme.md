# Discount Program
CashPal has decided to start two new discount programs targeting certain customers. The discounts are as follows:

1. All users over the age of 55 will qualify for a senior discount
2. In celebration of Canada Day - all Canadian (country_code "CA") users qualify for a discount
We want to return all the records from the users table, but we want to include an extra column to know whether each user qualifies for one of these discounts.

## Challenge
Return all the data from the users table and a temporary column aliased to discount_eligible.

The discount_eligible column should have a boolean value of true or false depending on whether the user matches the discount conditions listed above.
