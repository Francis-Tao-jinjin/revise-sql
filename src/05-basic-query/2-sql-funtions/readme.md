# SQL Functions

SQL is a programming language and like nearly all programming languages, it supports functions. We can use functions and aliases to calculate new columns in a query. This is similar to how you might use formulas in Excel.

## IIF function
In SQLite, the IIF function works like a ternary. For example,

```sql
IIF(carA > carB, "Car a is bigger", "Car b is bigger")
```
If a is greater than b, this statement evaluates to the string "Car a is bigger". Otherwise, it evaluates to "Car b is bigger".

Here's how we can use IIF() and a directive alias to add a new calculated column to our result set:

```sql
SELECT quantity,
    IIF(quantity < 10, "Order more", "In Stock") AS directive
    FROM products
```
## Assignment
We need to look through CashPal's transaction data and determine whether or not any of the transactions need to be audited.

Return all the data from the transactions table, and add an extra column at the end called audit.

If a row's was_successful field is true, the audit field should say "No action required".
If a row's was_successful field is false, the audit field should say "Perform an audit".

## Tip
Some equality operators in SQL:
=: Equal to
<: Less than
>: Greater than
