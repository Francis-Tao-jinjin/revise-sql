# Fraud Prevention

Users have reported to the CashPal support team that they've been contacted by some suspicious users who claim to work for CashPal - you've been asked to write a query to find people impersonating CashPal employees. These suspicious users have been putting cashpal and support in their usernames to impersonate real employees. Fortunately, every CashPal employee has their is_admin field set to true, so we can determine if a user is an employee.

## Challenge
Write a query that returns the name and username for every user that has the words cashpal or support somewhere in their username and is not an admin
